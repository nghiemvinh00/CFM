This is a very first phase of building a Cinema Filming Management system, which would be a replacement for Megastar current website.

In this phase I implemented 3 models:
MOVIE, CITY, PLACE 

MOVIE can be filmed in multiple CITIES 
MOVIE can use multiple PLACES to film scenes. 

CITIES can be used in filming of multiple MOVIES 
CITIES have many PLACES to be used for filming scenes 

PLACES can in the filming of many MOVIES 
PLACES can be found in only 1 city 

Putting it another way: 
MOVIE - CITY: Many to Many 
MOVIE - PLACE: Many to Many 
CITY - PLACE: One to Many 

MOVIES can be added stand alone 
CITIES can be added stand alone 
PLACES when added must be associated to a CITY, and a MOVIE 

After a MOVIE exists, a CITY can be associated to it (and vice versa) 
After a PLACE exists, an different MOVIE can be associated to it 

Need the following: 
- App that supports necessary assocations/relations above 
- Page to Add MOVIE. MOVIE just has a Name (text) 
- Page to Add a CITY. CITY has a Name (text) 
- Page to add a PLACE. PLACE has a Name (text) 

- Ability to associate an existing PLACE to an existing MOVIE 
- Ability to associate PLACE to CITY (must be done at time of creation of a PLACE) 
- Ability to associate an existing CITY to an existing MOVIE 
- When viewing a MOVIE, need to see all the CITIES used for that movie and all of the PLACES used for that MOVIE 
- When viewing a CITY, need to see all of MOVIES hosted in that CITY and a list of 10 PLACES within that CITY 
- When viewing a PLACE, seeing the MOVIES being hosted there and CITY that the place lives within 
- When looking at a specific MOVIE, an "add Place" button is provided which the user can then do the following: 
 + Add a new PLACE which the user mut provide PLACE name and associated CITY 
 + Select an existing PLACE to associate to. 
- When looking at a specific CITY, an "add Place" button is provided which the user can then do the following: 
 + Add a new PLACE which the user mut provide PLACE name 
- Broad drill downs, user can select MOVIE, then select a CITY associated to that MOVIE to view, then select a PLACE used in that CITY for filming that MOVIE.
